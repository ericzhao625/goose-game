# goose-game
An endless arcade Goose Escape with randomly generated maps, programmed using BearLibTerminal libraries.


Each level has increasingly complex mazes with more (G/M)eese to avoid! Make it to the safe zone to move on to the next level.
'i' = Your character
'G' = Goose which can fly over walls but move once every two moves you make (Avoid at all costs)
'M' = Moose which patrol areas "bouncing" from wall to wall (Avoid at all costs)
'%' = Safe Zone (The goal)
'*' = Bird Feed (Freeze the movement of geese - and meese (whom love bird feed as well, just trust me on that one))
